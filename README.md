# VisibleAlgebra
A white-box C++ implementation of Gaussian elimination with explicit row operations.



This project is a C++ implementation of Gaussian elimination designed to expose the process of linear algebra rather than hide it behind optimized solvers.

Matrices are transformed into Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) using explicit elementary row operations (row swaps, scaling, and row combinations), making each step easy to inspect, modify, or extend.

The goal is not performance, but transparency: a tool for learning, experimentation, and custom algorithm development where full control over the elimination process matters.
